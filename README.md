# Friday Night Funkin'

Friday Night Funkin' is a rhythm game. Built using HaxeFlixel for Ludum Dare 47.

This game was made with love to Newgrounds and its community. Extra love to Tom Fulp.

* [Playable web demo on Newgrounds!](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371)
* [Demo download builds for Windows, Mac, and Linux from Itch.io!](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin)

## Holy shit, FNF on mobile?

With this fan port we try and make it so FNF runs on mobile as if it was made FOR mobile gameplay. Coming toe-to-toe with what would be an official Friday Night Funkinâ€™ mobile build! Little to no new features will be added unless it really really REALLY enhances the mobile experience.

Currently speaking, this mobile port can: Load videos, mods, visualize sounds, basically everything else the base game does!
